Lisa's Sausage & Red Pepper Pasta
---------------------------------
2 pieces taro
3 tbsp fish sauce

Directions:
2. Sauté the onion until its layers separate from each other
5. Pour the water and bring to a boil
7. Put-in the sinigang mix



1 Tbsp vegetable oil
1/2 Tbsp dried oregano

2. Cook over medium heat until the sausage is browned and firm enough to slice. It doesn't have to be cooked through at this point.
5. Let them cook while you slice the sausage into thin medallions.
1/2 (19 oz.) package Italian sausage (hot, sweet, or mild)
1/2 Tbsp dried basil
1/4 tsp crushed red pepper (optional)

8. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of water to a boil and cook the pasta for about 7 minutes, or just until tender, but still firm. Slightly undercook the pasta as it will continue to cook and soak up liquid once added to the pot with the sausage and peppers.
9. Once the pasta is finished cooking, drain it in a colander and then add it to the pot with the sausage and peppers.
